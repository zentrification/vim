Setup with pathogen, a few colorschemes I like, and a small suite of plugins I find useful

## Utilities
update_bundles.rb is a small script that will help you move to pathogen.vim

## Credit
vimrc heavily influenced by 
https://github.com/rtomayko/dotfiles/blob/rtomayko/.vimrc

## Install
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
